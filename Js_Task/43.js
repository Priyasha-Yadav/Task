// 43. The "Max Consecutive Ones" problem is a common algorithmic challenge that involves finding the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.
// Problem Statement Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.
// Example
// Input: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
// Output: 3 (the longest sequence of 1s is 111)


function longest_binary(input){
    for(i=0;i<input.length;i++){
    if(){}
    }
