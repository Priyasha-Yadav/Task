# Task Repository

A collection of programming tasks and assignments spanning multiple technologies, including C, JavaScript, HTML, and full-stack development with React and Node.js.

## Overview

This repository houses a series of focused coding tasks, each housed in its own folder,  designed to practice and showcase skills across different programming paradigms and tech stacks.

### Directory Structure

- **C_Task** – C language questions
- **Js_Task** – JavaScript-specific questions
- **API_Task** – Backend API or server-side functionality
- **Frontend_Task** – UI-focused work using HTML/CSS
- **React_and_node_task** – Full-stack projects combining React frontend with Node.js backend

## Purpose

This repo serves as a self-driven learning journal, tracking my development as I explore different languages and frameworks. Each task is modular and designed to be explored independently.

## Technologies Used

- **C** – Foundational procedural programming
- **JavaScript** – Core scripting and dynamic behavior
- **HTML & CSS** – Structuring and styling web interfaces
- **Node.js** – Backend services and API handling
- **React** – Frontend SPA development and component architecture
